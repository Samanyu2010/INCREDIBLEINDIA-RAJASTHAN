            <p><font size="5">Rajasthan, known as the "Land of Kings", is a state in northern India. Famous for
 its historical forts, palaces, art, and culture, Rajasthan is a popular destination for tourists.
It is on India's northwestern side, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar

                 the main city. The magnificent Amer Fort is an extensive palace complex that has been built with pale yellow and 
                 pink sandstone, and with white marble.</font></p>

 Raja Man Singh built this fort in 1592 AD and Raja Jai Sigh I expanded<BR> and renovated it later. While many such old structures have been either destroyed or<BR>

width="500"
height=200"><font size="5">Kuldhara is a ghost village about 17 kilometres west of Jaisalmer. Three centuries ago it was a prosperous town, but 
today it is an abandoned village shrouded in mystery. The village was established in 1291 by the Paliwal Brahmins, and was a 
rather prosperous community thanks to their ability to grow bumper crops in the arid desert. But one night, in 1825, all the people
 in Kuldhara and the nearby 83 villages vanished in dark. Legend says that Salim Singh, the evil prime minister, set his eyes upon the 
daughter of the village head and declared he would marry her, with or without her consent. He threatened the villagers with dire consequences
 if they did not comply with his wishes. Rather than give in to his demands, the council of the villagers decide to leave their ancestral homes 
overnight. But before leaving they cursed Kuldhara so that no one would ever be able to settle there. True to the curse, the village remains abandoned.
 Nobody has been able to spend even a night in the village. The ruins of Kuldhara are a fine example of the architectural excellence of that era and draw
 photographers and movie-makers to their narrow lanes. Today, the village is a protected monument under State Archaelogy Department.</font></p>

height=300"><font size="5">Mehrangarh is a historic fort located in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India.It was initially built around 1459 by the Rajput ruler of
 Rathore clan Rao Jodha, though most of the existing structure is from the 17th century built by his successors. The fort has seven gates, which includes
 main entrance Jai Pol (meaning 'victory gate'), built by Maharaja Man Singh to commemorate his victories over the Jaipur and Bikaner armies in 1806.
 The Fattehpol (lit.â€‰'victory gate'), commemorates victory of Maharaja Ajit Singh over the Mughals.Within its boundaries, you'll find several palaces known
 for their intricate carvings and expansive courtyards, a Chamunda Mataji Temple, as well as a museum that houses various relics. A winding road leads to and from
 the city below. The imprints of the impact of cannonballs fired by attacking armies of Jaipur can still be seen on the second gate. At the north-east of the fort is
 the chhatri of Kirat Singh Sodha, a soldier who fell on the spot defending Mehrangarh.</font></p>

width="500"
height=200"><font size="5">The Jantar Mantar is a collection of 19 astronomical instruments built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of Jaipur,
 Rajasthan. The monument was completed in 1734. It features the world's largest stone sundial, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is near City 
Palace and Hawa Mahal. The instruments allow the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye. The observatory is an example of the Ptolemaic
 positional astronomy which was shared by many civilizations.The monument features instruments operating in each of the three main classical celestial 
coordinate systems: the horizon-zenith local system, the equatorial system, and the ecliptic system.The Kanmala Yantraprakara is one that works in two systems and
 allows transformation of the coordinates directly from one system to the other. It has the biggest sundial in the world.The monument was damaged in the 19th century. 
Early restoration work was undertaken under the supervision of Major Arthur Garrett, a keen amateur astronomer, during his appointment as Assistant State Engineer for
 the Jaipur District</font></p>

<p><img src="Jasalmeir Fort.jpg"

width="500"
height=200"><font size="5">Jaisalmer Fort is situated in the city of Jaisalmer, in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is one of the very few "living forts" in the
 world (such as Carcassonne, France), as nearly one fourth of the old city's population still resides within the fort. For the better part of its 860-year
 history, the fort was the city of Jaisalmer. The first settlements outside the fort walls, to accommodate the growing population of Jaisalmer, are said to have come 
up in the 17th century.Jaisalmer Fort is the second oldest fort in Rajasthan, built in 1156 AD by the Rawal (ruler) Jaisal from whom it derives its name, and stood at 
the crossroads of important trade routes (including the ancient Silk road). The fort's massive yellow sandstone walls are a tawny lion colour during the day, fading 
to honey-gold as the sun sets, thereby camouflaging the fort in the yellow desert. For this reason it is also known as the Swarn Durg, Sonar Quila or Golden Fort.
 The name Sonar Quila (Bengali for Golden Fortress) was popularized by tourists after famous Bengali film of the same name, that was shot in this fort by eminent
 filmmaker Satyajit Ray. The fort stands amidst the sandy expanse of the great Thar Desert on Trikuta Hill, hence also known as Trikutgarh. It is today located along
 the southern edge of the city that bears its name; its dominant hilltop location making the sprawling towers of its fortifications visible for many miles around.

 or seasoned with a variety of spices or made sweet (and then known as Lassi).[3] Chaas can be made from fresh yogurt, and the natural flavour of such chaas is mildly 
 sweet.Chaas can be consumed plain, but a little salt is usually added. This is the most common seasoning for chaas. Numerous other seasonings and spices can be
 added to salted chaas, either singly or in combination with each other. These spices are usually roasted in a wok, using a spoonful of cooking oil, before being
 added to the Chaas. The spices which can be added thus are: Coarsely ground and roasted cumin seeds, curry leaves, asafoetida, grated ginger, very finely diced green 
chillies and Mustard seeds. Sugar can also be added to chaas, but if sugar is added, then neither salt nor spice is usually used.</font></p>
